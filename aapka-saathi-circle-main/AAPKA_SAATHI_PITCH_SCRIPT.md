# Aapka Saathi - 5 Minute Video Pitch Script

## (0:00 - 0:45) The Problem: The Vendor's Double Loss

**Visuals:** Fast-paced montage: alarm clock at 4 AM, chaotic market scenes, tired vendor carrying heavy bags. On-screen text appears: "2-3 Hours Lost Daily", "10-15% Income Lost to Waste".

**Narration:** 
> "Meet Raju Kumar. He runs a beloved Chole Bhature stall in Gurgaon. But every single day, Raju faces a crushing double loss. 
>
> First, he loses 3 precious hours and his peace of mind at the wholesale mandi, trapped in dependency on middlemen he calls 'arhatiyas' - commission agents who control his access to credit and dictate opaque pricing.
>
> Second, he loses up to 15% of his potential income to food that spoils or gets thrown away. Yesterday's unsold onions become today's financial loss - a leak that goes straight from his thin profit margins to the landfill."

## (0:45 - 1:15) The Unique Insight: A Circular Solution

**Visuals:** Animated transformation showing a linear supply chain (Farm → Mandi → Vendor → Waste Bin) with money visibly leaking out at each stage. This transforms into a circular loop labeled "Aapka Saathi," where the waste arrow curves back to the vendor as golden coins.

**Narration:**
> "Every other solution in the market sees procurement as a one-way street. We see it as a circle.
>
> What if the same system that delivers fresh produce to Raju's stall could also turn yesterday's organic waste into today's working capital?
>
> Introducing Aapka Saathi - India's first two-way circular economy platform that doesn't just solve procurement inefficiencies, it transforms vendor waste liability into a tangible financial asset."
